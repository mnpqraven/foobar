Let's seal this greeting with the passion from a razor's kiss.
Compassion, a virtue never synonymous with this name.
Now my gaze pierces two sets of somber eyes,
Of which only dreams had brought in yesteryear.
My misery, my bane, and my envy personified.
I will take everything from you.
I will replicate an assembled heart, forged from your collective agony,
And I will tear away until there are but two beating hearts before me.
I will tear away, for my greatest triumph lies in the:
Fear, loathing, resentment, and spite
Will scourge them both for the rest of their wretched days.
