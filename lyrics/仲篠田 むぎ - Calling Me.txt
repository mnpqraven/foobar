[Music: Axel Rudi Pell]
[Lyrics: Charlie Huhn / Axel Rudi Pell]

Sneakin' thru the darkness, silence all around
Daddy's not at home tonight, lost and never found
howlin'at the full moon, hear a distant cry,
tattoed Queen awaits me, passion in her eyes

Hot desire, feel the fire
the moment she started to dance
guns for hire red hot wire
screamin' myself in a trance

like a wild cat - iyah iyah
like a wild cat, breakin' out of my cage
like a wild cat - iyah iyah
like a wild cat
ahhh

Stalk my feline prey, wrestle her to the ground,
rollin' like thunder, hear the wild cat sound,
stong will survive, this beast you'll never tame,
cruise jungle city, tomorrow'll be the same

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]
