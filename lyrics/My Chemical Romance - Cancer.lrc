[00:11.25]turn away,,
[00:17.43]If you could get me a drink of water
[00:21.81]Cause my lips are chapped and faded
[00:24.97]Call my Aunt Marie.
[00:29.35]Help me gather all my things,
[00:33.20]and bury me in all my favourite colours.
[00:38.20]My sisters and my brothers still.
[00:42.58]I will not kiss you.
[00:46.09][01:00.08][01:33.18][02:05.60] 
[00:49.32][01:54.71]Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you.
[01:04.26]Now turn away.
[01:08.09]Cause I'm awful just to see.
[01:11.77]Cause all my hairs abandoned all my body
[01:16.42]all my agony.
[01:21.06]Know that I will never marry.
[01:24.50]and baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo,
[01:29.39]but counting down the days to go.
[01:33.97]And just ain't living.
[01:37.59]And I just hope you know.
[01:42.41]That if you say goodbye today.
[01:48.42]I'd ask you to be true.
[02:07.68]Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
