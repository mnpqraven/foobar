This Is your life
Worthless Denial across your face,
control feeble minds then destroy our race.
Helpless die for you in vain,
devour all our pride lead us to disgrace.

Wake up nation,
see the reason,
why we've become,
hates own victim.

If the answer is so clear then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind.

Thoughtless trust into the lies,
resent what your told see the truth inside
senseless accusations rise
divide ourselves from what they call divine
This is your life
Don't be so blind
This is your life
Don't be so blind
wake up nation, see the reason, why we've become, hates own victim.

If the answer is so clear
Then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind. [x2]

Take a look at what you believe in.
Take a chance and follow my reason
now we all unite in unison
I can't be stopped

If the answer is so clear
Then why are we so blind?
Escape from ourselves and leave it all behind. [x2]

Escape from ourselves, and leave it all behind. [x4]
