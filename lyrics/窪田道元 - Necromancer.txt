With weapons drawn, we claim the future
Advancing far through every storm
Bring in the fold, to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk to dawn

Firepower! Petrify
Firepower

The dye is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally 'round this flag of freedom
Our union thrives or go to Hell

Firepower! Taking lives
Firepower! Neutralize

Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world cries of danger
Is bound to explode

[Solo: Ritchie]

Aim for the target
With laser red light
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight

No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in dis-contrition
With open arms, we fight for peace
We fight with...

Firepower! Petrify
Firepower! Between the eyes
Firepower! Mortifies
Firepower! Man's demise
