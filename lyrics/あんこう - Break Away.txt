We're wandering through the dark without a single spark
Without a sign of day
But still through saddest grey in all our hearts will stay
The will to carry on

The fire that's deep inside me's burning on forever

We're the last of the heroes
No we're never to fall
We're the last of the heroes
Til the end of the world

I'm walking through the cold without a light to hold
But til the end I'll go
And just like me you'll see that hope there'll always be
As long as you believe

I know the fire that's deep inside you's burning on forever

We're the last of the heroes
No we're never to fall
We're the last of the heroes
Til the end of the world

We're the last of the heroes
No we're never to fall
We're the last of the heroes
Till the end of the world
