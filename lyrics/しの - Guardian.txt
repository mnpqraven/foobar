Now the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done

[Ref.:]
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back

[Solo]

[Ref.]
Run, run, run

Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost

[Ref.]
Run, run
