There's a light at the end of the tunnel – it's rock and roll
There's no fight – words into action – your life is your own
The curtains rising – take the thunder – it's yours to hold
(I say) let's celebrate it – we can generate it

The main attraction – satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you

Keep the faith – your time has come feel the beat
Don't play safe – the sky is the limit – no need to retreat
So take your best shot – and place your bet on what you know (nothing to lose)
The stage is set now – you've got the know how

(for the) main attraction – satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you
The main attraction – your reaction
Guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you

In the end – we'll stand in the spotlight – we are the show (here we go)
We'll defend – here's the performance – it's all we know
We've captured the moment
The power and the glory – is ours to hold (and we'll never let go)
It's a celebration – the instigation

It's the main attraction – satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you
The main attraction – your reaction
Guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you
