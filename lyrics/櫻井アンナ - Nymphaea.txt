"Disperse my seed that my minions may gather.
Beneath sylvan umbrage my own shadow will grow."

So rose and spoke the stygian flora

"You shall be the prophet of my upheaval.
You shall be my sword."

"Await the time of Sagittarius to unsheath your spade.
By your hand, terminal clusters propagate.
From your ardor shall bloom my doom."

"From the soil my reign shall grow.
From your toil my brethren shall rise.
To reclaim the earth shall you serve me
And reap your reward."

"For yours shall be the final effacement of mankind
Not in death shall you end,
But in transmuted life eternal.
Incorporated into the Chlorophyllic Continuum
Shall you live on evermore."

I am yours, pentatheric master
Your germination is my task
May your red plantae legions
Sow the seed of the Budding Dawn

Tearing down the human presence
Uprooting their destructive ways
Your dominion will I engineer

May flora again reign supreme
