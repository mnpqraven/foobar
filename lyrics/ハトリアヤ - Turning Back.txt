NO WAY!!!

It made me become what I am
It'll make me become what I want to be
Experiences gained from the past
The scars never heal but will help me see

Coldhearted souls in a coldhearted world
Were holding me back, didn't want to follow
Their rules or to live their normal kind of life
My spirit is free, don't you see?

[Chorus]
That I'm never turning back
Back to those times again
I'm never turning back
Back to those years
No, I'll never be turning back
Back to those times again
Never turning back
Back to those years--No way!

It makes you a slave once you're born
It'll make you a person without a heart
A beast, always there from the start
That in the end will be tearing your soul apart!

Coldhearted souls in a coldhearted world
Are holding you back, do you want to follow
Their rules, or live their normal kind of lives
Your spirits are free, don't you see?

[Chorus]
That you'll never be turning back
Back to those times again
You'll never be turning back
Back to those years
No, you'll never be turning back
Backt o those times again
Never turning back
Back to those years--No way!
