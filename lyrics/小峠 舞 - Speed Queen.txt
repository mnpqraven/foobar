Looking out into the silent night
And see the fires burn
Across the streets, beyond this life
There is no return
Black angel, comes with delight
And with demonic breath
You will be her prey tonight
Prepare yourself for death

Black Angel - Show your wrath
Black Angel - You cross my path
Black Angel

Can you hear her voice tonight
Yes can you hear her cries
Look deep into her glance
She can kill you with her eyes
Don't you ever come so close
She's got you on her track
In the night she's watching you
Just waiting to attack

Black Angel - Show your wrath
Black Angel - You cross my path
Black Angel

Looking out into the silent night
And see the fires burn
Across the streets, beyond this life
There is no return
Black angel, comes with delight
And with demonic breath
You will be her prey tonight
Prepare yourself for death

Black Angel - Show your wrath
Black Angel - You cross my path
Black Angel
