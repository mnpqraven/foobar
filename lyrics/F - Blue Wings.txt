[A. Torricini, F. Rubulotta]

Timeless, searching for a piece of blue and brightness
Trying to touch the sun light
Now I know, My heart needs to feel the sky, this ether's sea
And I start to breathe the air... Oh, standing on the shore...

Airness, mountains breeze in my sense when I reach my top
'Cause I need to breathe air
When clouds cover my isolation, looking for a dawn
Trying to see the red light

Oh, standing on the shore
And taking deep, breaths my soul to store

The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly up in the sky
The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly
I'm missing the sky

Turning, turn my face to sun, I wanna warm my skin
Trying to feel the sun light
Over me, grey concrete I just can see my irony
While I need to breathe air

Oh, standing on the shore
And taking deep, breaths my soul to store

The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly up in the sky
The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly
I'm missing the sky

[Solo: Tower, Vic]

Missing the sky, Missing the sky
Like a bird needs to fly
Missing the sky, Missing the sky
Like a bird needs to fly

The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly up in the sky
The fallen angel, far from the sky
Spreads the wings to fly
I'm missing the sky
