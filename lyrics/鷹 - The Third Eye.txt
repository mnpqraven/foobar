Embraced in my dream, absurd as it may seem
You're slave under my illusion, the everdark of mine
Sodomize your shallow mind
Swirling images rise, constructed by my lies
In my shadows all your fear is true, it is all too real
Resurrect the thoughts I steal

In my darkness, in which you're lost
Dreaming blindly, the line is crossed
Agitation, you're giving in
Submission, a life without sin

Crucifixion of your will, your conscious cruel demise
If you sin the beast inside arise, I sense it now, join me
Share afterlife's welfare
Exposed to your fear, now you no longer care
Your soul and mind are possessed by me
Believe the lies I tell, when I say I wish you well

In my darkness, in which you're lost
Dreaming blindly, the line is crossed
Blessing, obsessive, oppressive, submissive

Deep in belief, you worship me
Now forever protected from the fears inside
Your fate is secured, if you live in submission

Succumbed to my lies, your mind blank
Obsessed with heaven, christian faith
I am god

[Solo: Peter]

Guidance, guided for life, to you I'm out of reach
Too weak to think of yourself as god
You made me yours through fear, it's all but crystal-clear
Crucified is your integrity, hung dead upon the cross
Followed by your thoughts and all your dreams
They stand in line to die, not once you raise objections

Deep in belief, you worship me
Now forever protected from the fears inside
Your fate is secured, if you live in submission
