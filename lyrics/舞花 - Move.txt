Unholy angel cast down from the sky
Taking out his vengeance on mankind
Ancient defier that leads the world astray
The dragon and his angels on a rampage

Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Slayer of Souls
The serpent of old
Wielding deceit
The Slayer, the Slayer of Souls

The devil's fury is always making war
Because he knows his time is short
The great accuser, the masses he misleads
Standing on the shore of every sea

Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Slayer of Souls
The serpent of old
Wielding deceit
The Slayer, the Slayer of Souls

The great deceiver
The beast out of the sea
His mouth is full of blasphemes

Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
Slayer of Souls
The serpent of old
Wielding deceit
The Slayer, the Slayer of Souls
