An original crazy
In a world that I've never known
My life is so rearranging
Where you end up can you ever know?

I gotta get out
And tear this whole place to the ground

In the night we'll be kicking, screaming
Pickin' through the pasts' remains
In your eyes a future again
Make me go insane
Where we go we can never tell
Just take my hand and lead me through this hell

You whispered Prendimi Ora
I'm roaring "take me now"
You can't imagine the horror
That you saved me from somehow

I gotta get out
From under the weight of this world

In the night we'll be kicking, screaming
Pickin' through the pasts' remains
In your eyes a future again
Make me go insane
Where we go we can never tell
Just take my hand and lead me through this hell

In the night we'll be kicking, screaming
Pickin' through the pasts' remains
In your eyes a future again
Make me go insane
Where we go we can never tell
Just take my hand and lead me through this hell
And lead me through this hell
