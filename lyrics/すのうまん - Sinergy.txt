(The land of replaced souls)

Shudders of life
Through my fainted eyes run
What astonishment
Those golden mountains

They raise sage
Omniscent dust throughout time

Orgies of colours
White clouds reflect
From waving flowers... so bright
The wind caresses the ancient foliage
The leaves whisper like voices saying...

Welcome
To the land of replaced souls
Here human soul
Is delighted in everlasting peace...

You who blows emotions
Through skylight splinters... please
Disclose to my soul
Sweating bare roots

Overgrown with moss
Crystal-clear waters they cry

High foamy crests
From this sea of pureness
Twirl placidly up to the sky
The waves split on hard clouds
The uproar resounds like a voice whispering...

Welcome
To the land of replaced souls
Here human soul
Is delighted in everlasting peace...

We all will return
To the elements of the primordial scenery
