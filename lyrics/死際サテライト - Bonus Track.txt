What do you think when you spit in my face
How does it feel to accuse and to haze
Now look at me, I'm not one of your kind
And I prefer to stay behind
And walk the wicked way

We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools

We are never gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You're the blind to lead the blind
And I walk the wicked way

You feel at ease as you flock with the masses
What do you see with your heads in their asses
Keep on railing at what I believe
Call me insane and I am proud to be
And walk the wicked way

We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools

We're not gonna be like you
We don't follow - king of fools
You are the blind to lead the blind - oh
