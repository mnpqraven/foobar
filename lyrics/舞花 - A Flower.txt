Light and brightness tied up together
Waiting innocently on the bed to be raped by the night
We are celebrating, our birthday like twins
We are brave, scared, wounded and scarred by ourselves.
In this night everything that is right is wrong and still so pleasing
In our fight everything that is wrong is right and so comforting
And we have just began, again, one of you is part of our game…

Welcome, to the dark side of love
Here innocence is decadence and weirdness is a virtue
Here my touch will hurt you, all forbidden is allowed
My dear make yourself comfortable.
The doors are closed, the lights are down
Your eyes are wide shut while I make you feel my presence
I'll breath on your skin, let's taste the sin
All you have to do is obey
My orders are clear, just obey.

There are a few things I want to do
There are things I want from you...
Two roles in this game so attractive
I am playing both at the same time, I am two
There are a few things I want to do
There are things I want from you...
Soon I'll show you my twisted tools
I am two and you are just one of the fools.

Are you ready to suffocate
From this air so endearing for me?
Don't try to hear, don't try to see
It's easier to suffocate…

There are two in me when thirteen candles are lit
A foreplay for the wolves
There are two in me when thirteen candles are lit
A foreplay for the wolves...
A foreplay for the wolves...
A foreplay for the wolves...

Are you ready to disappear
From the world so cruel to you?
Or do you want to hide from me?
Together we could disappear easily…

Are you ready to suffocate
From this air so endearing for me?
Don't try to hear, don't try to see
It's easier to suffocate…

Light and brightness tied up together
Waiting innocently on the bed to be raped by the night
I am celebrating, my birthday like a twin
I am brave, scared, wounded and scarred by myself
…And I have just began...

There are two in me when thirteen candles are lit
A foreplay for the wolves
There are two in me when thirteen candles are lit
A foreplay for the wolves...

Thirteen candles are lit - A foreplay for the wolves
There are two in me - A foreplay for the wolves...
