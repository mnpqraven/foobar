Death head smiles
The hammer strikes
Thundering the names
Everything you know is naught
And never be regained

The spear is thrust
The iron sparks
Cutting through the lamb
Cults of death
And Ragnarok
Calling down the end

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Hammer of the gods at hand

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Hammer of the gods at hand

Grinning death
Wooden like
Courses through your breath
Everything you knew is dead
And never live again

The hammer strikes
Upon the land
Knights of lightning raise
Every living thing you knew
Will never be the same

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Hammer of the gods at hand

Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Hammer of the gods at hand

Knights of lightning raise
Knights of lightning raise
