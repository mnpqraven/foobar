On the might of kings and captains
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
I know my hatred is perfect for the culprit
Who deserves
It dead meat
Against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
But there is no dream
Worth pursuing
When there is no body embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling
On the might of kings and captains
On the eyes of midnight watchmen
I know my hatred is perfect for the culprit
Who deserves
It's dead meat
Against your broken bones
Thrown in a ditch to die alone
But there is no dream worth pursing
When there is no body embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling
I know my hatred is pure
For the new recruit
123 go imposters
On the fast track to public execution
Beggars for morely unite
But your pleas are ineffective
And if you ever come back
Beautiful incarnation
I'll lay down at your feet
And accept my punishment
You better save yourself
You better save yourself
You better save yourself
There is no dream worth pursing
When there is no body embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
When there is no blood worth spilling
There is no dream worth pursing
When there is no body embracing
And there is no war worth fighting
