Spinning out mind (Poison)
That's headache taste on the tip of my tongue
I can't take you (Medicine)
You're so bitter, better get up and run

Warning! Eye for an eye
When revenge comes charging
Warning! Eye for an eye
You won't see it coming
..You won’t see it coming..

If you carry on
You won't win that fight
If you take me on
You'll find my breaking point

Please don't test my (Patience)
My short fuse you don’t wanna ignite
Do not scratch the (Surface)
Don't wake the beast 'cause he's ready to bite

Warning!
Eye for an eye
When revenge comes knocking
Warning!
Eye for an eye
You won't feel it coming
..You won't feel it coming..

If you carry on
You won't win that fight
If you take me on
You'll find my breaking point

Everybody's got a breaking point
Nobody wants to see that side of me
Stop pushing, 'cause I won't back down
Nobody's gonna bring that by me

[Solo]

It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye
It's an eye for an eye

If you carry on
You won't win that fight
If you take me on
You'll find my breaking point

I'm at my breaking point!
