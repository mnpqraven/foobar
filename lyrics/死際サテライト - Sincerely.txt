[feat. Rachel Aspe of Eths]

Come and hate me.
Welcome, all my enemies.
Do forgive me if I forced you to think when you thought you were thinking.
The pain of true understanding is not a pain I bemoan you suffer.
Rather, necessary, if you mean to have more mind than a fool.

Speak in truth. Oppose against. Denounce accepted misbelief.
Impose bitter reality and you still be sincerely hated.

In combat for every fact that conforms to whim and comfort; to sustain critical thinking, we quarrel.
A repulsive reflection leaves you ill at ease,
Still, the mirror is cracked with no concern for what you prefer to believe.

Speak in truth. Oppose against. Denounce accepted misbelief.
Impose bitter reality and you still be sincerely hated.

If you can be destroyed by the truth, you deserve to be destroyed by the truth.

I question your beliefs, openly scrutinize your process of thinking and perception of reality, as you should question mine.
May we all gain a better understanding of our lives.

I think, therefore I am sincerely hated, as sure as I stand.

Speak in truth. Oppose against. Denounce accepted misbelief.
I impose bitter reality. Proud to be sincerely hated, sincerely hated, sincerely fucking hated.
