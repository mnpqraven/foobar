Drawn by the power of the ultraviolet sun
Spinning eye of the Lord, it looks upon
Magnetic cobs spread forth and spin a web
I can see a thousand worlds right here in my bed
Oh yeah

Looking all around, the world's a dream
Traveling to places that I have never seen
High up here is where I'm really free
Listen people, you've got to free the weed
Oh yeah

Yeah, you knew the deal
You knew I would make you feel
But look around you, what you got
No hope, no future, no fuckin' job
Yeah
