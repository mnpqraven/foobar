[Music:Fang/Vitoz Lyrics:Vitoz]

My great fear from where it comes?
And where it goes out,I don't know.

It's look like sand in a bosom.
It's look like burning hair.

My great fear from where it comes
And where it goes out,I don't know.

May be the north wind brings
it with itself
And maybe I'm a tree
And maybe I'm fate,I'm fate.

It's look like sand in a bosom.
It's look like burning hair.

Maybe I drink it with water
running from my vein.
And maybe I'm a tree
And maybe I'm fate,I'm fate.
