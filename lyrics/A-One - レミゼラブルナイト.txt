Compelled to copulate
I'm not disappointed to be ugly as a human
when the lancet starts to pierce my skin, slashing, cutting the reproductive
tool compel to copulate
castrate, dissect the base of human silliness
finish with the impulsion
I disowned what I don't deserve
sex is now running your lives
harassed by subjective circumstances
we succumb by machination
too much subliminal
it's infecting our brain
regularly soaking with sex
humans drowning in a pathetic circle, more disgusting than animal instincts
man has pushed the nastiness too far, constantly present in everyone's mind
rise in an infatuated world our soul impregnated with sexual perversion and
sickening growing variations
this is just a fragmentation that I'll eternally desecrate
revolting state of being for human kind
I hope your misrepresentation will wipe out human races with all viral
syndromes created by your avidity
you will suffer when your infected blood will condemn your pathetic
existence of bestial activities.
