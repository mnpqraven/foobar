Your mother always told you 
It doesn't matter boy 
Cause we are all the same 
And then she used to hold you 
In the waves of joy 
But life is not a game 

When you're out there on your own 
With no one at your side 
And you're feeling all alone 
You're all alone 

That's when you find out 
Nobody wants you 
Nobody needs you 
Nobody feeds you 
On the wrong side of the street 
When you're a stranger 
You are in danger 
On the wrong side of the street 

And then as you grow older 
You kinda learn to fight 
It's the only way you know 
And as the nights grow colder 
You've got to survive 
And the anger starts to grow 

When you're out there on your own 
With no one at your side 
And you're feeling all alone 
You're all alone 

That's when you find out 
Nobody wants you 
Nobody needs you 
Nobody feeds you 
On the wrong side of the street 
When you're a stranger 
You are in danger 
On the wrong side of the street  

You tried so hard to please her 
It was all in vain 
The prison gates have closed now 
If only you could ease her 
Ease her of the pain 
Cause that's where it hurts the most 

When you're out there on your own 
With no one at your side 
And you're feeling all alone 
You're all alone 

That's when you find out 
Nobody wants you 
Nobody needs you 
Nobody feeds you 
On the wrong side of the street 
When you're a stranger 
You are in danger 
On the wrong side of the street
