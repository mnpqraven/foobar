Grotesque awakening in filthy embrace
With the cradle of existence eye to eye
A moonlit reflection shows a tortured face
It must be mine, I can't deny

Black night - darkness and stars
Outcast and forsaken in this hostile place
No past - frozen memories
Lost in the abyss between time and space

"You feel as if you were completely newborn
Your amnesia has wiped away your personality
But the embers of your true self are still burning
Brighter than ever before"

Deceptions flash like lightnings
Don't know what life is about
Is this just illusion?
A hidden sense I doubt
Creeping through the shadows
Cannot ease my pain
A life without a meaning
Makes me grow insane

Grotesque vegetating in filthy embrace
With my inner dark side eye to eye
A moonlit reflection shows a restless face
I must find the truth behind this lie
