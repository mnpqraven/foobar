For over a thousand years
They fought against the conquerors
Masses of human breeds
Threatened them by water and earth

In the fields of sorrow
So many lost...
The time had come
Of gods beware...

The stars of honour led their way
As the moons reached the ground
The spirits gathered and came forth
Invincible knowledge...
You belong to us

In the fields of sorrow
So many lost...
The time had come
Of gods beware...

...Perpetual remembrance
...In the memory of those who died
...For the blood that had been spilled
...Their name marks

The way to the skies
