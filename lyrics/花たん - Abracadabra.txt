[Based on “Toccata & Fuge in D Minor” by Johann Sebastian Bach]

We are one
You and I
Forevermore

We are one
You and I
A replica

Trying, struggling, hiding and denying.
Everything that has been will be again.
I am facing that still I'm chasing
everything you created.
And worlds collide and skies are closing in.
End it now. Let it begin

If I die, If I'm gone,
I'll have left behind another Replica.
It is me who you are.
We will be, what we've been,
what we are is what we'll be forevermore.
We're A Replica.

It has been foretold: It will unfold.
The course of time will finally collide.
Your creation done by another one.
Another life lived on the other side.
Those who return will be already there.
Creating another deja-vu.
Side by side. A timeline shared. Again I am you.
Worlds collide and skies are closing in.
End it now. Let it begin.

If I die, If I'm gone,
I'll have left behind another Replica.
It is me who you are.
We will be, what we've been,
what we are is what we'll be forevermore.
We're one Replica.
if I fail, again I try,
I'll surely create another Replica.
It is you who I am.
We will be, what we've been,
what we are is what we'll be forevermore.
A Replica.
This work will be done again.
Another Replica
