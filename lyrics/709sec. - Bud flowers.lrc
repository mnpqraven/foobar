[00:36.00]Windflowers . my father told me not to go near them.

[00:58.00]Windflowers, Beautiful windflowers
[01:03.00]I couldn't wait to touch them,
[01:07.00]to smell them I held them closely.
[01:12.00]And now I cannot break away.
[01:21.00][02:40.00]Their sweet bouquet disappears
[01:27.00]like the vapor in the desert. So take a warning, son.
[01:40.00]Windflowers . Ancient windflowers.
[01:46.00]Their beauty captures every young dreamer who lingers near them.
[01:53.00]But ancient windflowers, I love you.
