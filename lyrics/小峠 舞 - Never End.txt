Once upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony,
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught in the border
Let's get in contact
By the laws of mine

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!

Far out in space
I ride on,
Time is chasing us all,
It's not quite how it seems,
It's just a dream.

I don't believe
In a soul out of god
It's just twisted!
Fellow
You do not understand.

Each single breath inspires
you to come to an end - expire.

Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border,
Reveal the secret
One more soul to burn

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!

Something I'm close to,
something left to do
Draw near and prove yourself for brightening
Prepare yourself, don't wait for me,
Expect the day when I come

You have reached out for a while,
You may feel (down),
There's a wreck there, don't turn your eyes

Don't visions bleak,
And its colour's black,
Oh far beyond there is a star in dying sun

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!
