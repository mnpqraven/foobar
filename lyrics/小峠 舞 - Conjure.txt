Saviour poison symbol mankind's weakened sum arms and a trunk burned into the sun
Skepticism tilt it summit blackened perched in
Black windows for miles the stare of the sky
Blinding devised crumble the site force it down
Blame kept it uninvolved forever the answer to droll prayers
Grid-tilted upside-down for pleasure inversion of the fixture
Diversion sans elixir the steeple will fall

Pleased fleece gleam ceased drone spell bellowed then snatched form
Portents of storm eclipse the sun insects amok hate it but embrace fate's wake
Down swinging rat relegation thriving the shun there's more than one faith under the sun frame one now
Truth kept us uninvolved forever the answer to droll prayers faith-tilted upside-down for pleasure.
Inversion of the failures excursion cell of jailers and their steeples will fall
Heirs of the late have been searching high and low for you and I the steeple will fall
The people will crawl steeple will fall
