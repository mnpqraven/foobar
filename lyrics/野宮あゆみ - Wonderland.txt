Golden dreams, sick sick sick
Infatuation, blood red lips
Whips and chains, nice round hips
I show no mercy, bet you love the tits
Hypnotized, got no clue
You wanna love me black and blue

I am the one you want (you want me)
I am the one you crave (you crave me)
I'm the one you need (you need me)
And you will be my slave (crave)

Full of love, full of hate
Full of lust, so I violate
Kiss of death, lake of fire
Your blackened soul, baby, full of desire
You love to see me work it, you love to see me dance
You love to see me naked, got you in a trance
Shake that ass, shake that ass
I know you love it when I shake that ass

I am the one you want (you want me)
I am the one you crave (you crave me)
I'm the one you need (you need me)
And you will be my slave (crave)

I am the one you want
I am the one you crave
I'm the one you need
And you will be my slave

I am the one you want (you want me)
I am the one you crave (you crave me)
I'm the one you need (you need me)
And you will be my slave (crave)

Crave...
