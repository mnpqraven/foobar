Ripping itself outward of this blinding womb
Repressive thoughts scorched amid earthly tombs
Withering limbs onset the path for liberation
Defleshed essence unbinds from its creation

Flight unto the kingdom dominated by retinence
Twisted beings roam immured in depressive silence
Misery abounds within these walls of derangement
Innate sore pulsates in this embodied confinement

Ripping itself outward of this blinding womb
Repressive thoughts scorched amid earthly tombs
Withering limbs onset the path for liberation
Defleshed essence unbinds from its creation

Flight unto the kingdom dominated by retinence
Twisted beings roam immured in depressive silence
Misery abounds within these walls of derangement
Innate sore pulsates in this embodied confinement

Drowned in the poverty, richness will never counterweigh
Dawn upon dawn; pain ramifies, obscuring the light of day

Withered shell, eroded by flaming winds - incising deep
Shackled by the senses, frozen in eternal sleep
Absorbed within the vortex and spat away from time

At one with celestial void
Chanting hymns - unearthly sublime
Within the waters of resurrection
Breathes the morrow in utter dejection
Blinded youth crowned with repression
Nailed with pestilence the day of parturition
