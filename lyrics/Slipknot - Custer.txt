(This song is not for the living
This song is for the dead)

With my face against the floor
I can't see who knocked me out of the way
I don't want to get back up
But I have to, so it might as well be today

Nothing appeals to me,
No one feels like me
I'm too busy being calm to disappear

I'm in no shape to be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear

So walk with me
Walk with me
Don't let this symbolism kill your heart

Walk with me
Walk with me
Just like we should've done right from the start

Walk with me
Walk with me
Don't let this fucking world tear you apart
