Silently advancing a black silhouette
With evil intent
Acting their will
Another one’s spited

Holding a grudge all for things not well known
Desire to harm
You don’t listen
Another one’s spited!

Burning and scolding with great force and fury
A family is near
Power to control and persuade
You’ve been spited

Imposing your punishment on other men’s pride
Injustice of life
Take a care to explain
Extortions are simply insane
We’ve been spited

Won’t you see the light?
Ignoring the worst of the world today
Burning the torches so bright
Don’t be deceived follow me
Follow me
