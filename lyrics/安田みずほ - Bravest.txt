"My life blood is shed, steel painted red. A thousand men beat, I hold in my heart the flame of my people. Never shall I lower my eyes before any challenge or fo, but ever shall I bend back in service of my folk. Never let the fire die."

We are now prepared to die
This time we won't be denied
For Odin's pride we fight
Fists and swords standing up the air
Chants of battle, we raise every voice
For Odin's pride we fight

No remorse and no retreat
Our lives we lay down to thee
Honor us with your Valkyries

Let the ravens fly with our rallying cry
Extreme waves of golden revenge
Among their strongest men
Age of axes, shields splitting guts and skulls
Raven following throughout battle
Eating the bodies of the dead souls

Send their souls to Hell and ours to the mighty battle
Blasting with rage in our eyes
We burn this field as their land burnt black
Our spears cut through armor and skin
Victory is near, Valhalla shall wait 
Odin's sons we are, warriors with hearts of war

We know no fear, so many lost
Yet so many reward
We didn't want to choose
Faith choose for us
