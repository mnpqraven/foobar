Hello, is there anybody out there
Anybody out there to hear me call
Now I, I gotta take my chances
I gotta take chances
To get outta this place
Explode into space

I feel it coming
Feel it in my soul, I'm bursting up
Inside with my freight train heart
I'm rolling down the track

[refrain:]
Breakout, keep the fire burning
Breakout, keep the wheel turning
Breakout, I gotta have my freedom
Breakout, I've been waiting
Breakout, anticipating
Breakout, I gotta have my freedom

Tonight chains are gonna break down
There'll be a shakedown
Breaking through the barriers
When I, when I'm where I wanna be
No more under lock and key
There's no going back
No turning back

I feel it coming
Feel it in my soul, I'm bursting up
Inside with my freight train heart
I'm rolling down the track

[refrain]

I feel the hunger rising
I feel it in my bones and in my heart
And nothing stops me now

[refrain]
