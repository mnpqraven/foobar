Pestilent calvary
Of sadness iniquity
My growing will to kill
Shall crumble the immaculate.

Crossing the Styx
There is no return
Sailing blood red
Seas of rotting flesh.

Excruciate!
At war with god
Excruciate!
We will dominate.

Marching over ruins
Of the fallen earth
Worship idols with horns
And black wings.

Upon the altar of sacrifice
Stabbing the wound of Nazarene
Erase the fools of Christian race.

King of flies, the time has come
Serenades to the funeral rites
Perpetual genocide.

Marching over ruins
Of the fallen earth
Worship idols with horns
And black wings.

Crossing the Styx
There is no return
Sailing blood red
Seas of rotting flesh
