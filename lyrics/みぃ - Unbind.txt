All night, bleeding from the nose, and kept wide awake by trees against my roof
All white, dressing by the bed, and hummed a melody of a song you know I hate

And I went berserk and cut my face, and dragged it down the glass, while watching me with wide eyes as your pale skin glows
And I learned in time to curse myself, and lost the money that I'd won, but as hopeless as the haunted, they're a cold white moon

And all night, I am misery or dragging cloud, in an old stone house
And all night, I am torn between an endless spin and a pale girl

Fly blown in the mire, owed all in line, and laid by the wheel
But all was a dream, cold white moon hung over me
And I curse myself, moon glow over me, cold white moon glow over me

By the light of the moon, I held shards in my hand, and she begged 'no contact', each hand is rhythm, each will flow
Woke in piss and in blood, face down on the floor, 'no love no talk no contact', each man is living, each is told
I'm the song that you hummed and embody all the words, 'no love no talk no contact', each word is coded, each word flows

I've lost it all
Spent, drunk and gambled it, but I possess the void, now I'm the dragging cloud

I'm a dragging cloud, fly blown in the mire, I love nothing and no one and regret all I've done
