Let's go back a few years and look on all the lies
That you fed to me and yourself
The standards you held so highly
The book you followed so closely
Was it all nothing to you?
Was it all nothing to you?
Just a phase you were going through
Just a chance to call yourself one of the few?
Your words gave me something more
Something real to me, but it wasn't you
But it wasn't you

Oh God forgive me for turning my back on you
(my back on you)
For letting others influence the belief that I have in you
If I walk away with one thing from all of this
It's to never again put my faith in man
Put my faith in man

Maybe one day you will see the mistake in your decision
The flaws in your revision
I can't believe it was nothing to you
Was it all nothing to you?
Just a phase you were going through
Or just a chance to call yourself one of the few?

Oh God forgive me for turning my back on you
(my back on you)
For letting others influence the belief that I have in you
You'll never give up on me
You never stop letting me know that you're right here beside me
You never give up
You never give up
God, show me the way
God, show me my way

He will always be there for you
