Nightmares, they come in many stages
High chairs, some apply to all the ages
Princess, you only see through you
Queen mother, the wrinkled bitch is you, it’s you too!

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
You’re numb to the ages, you’re chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!

Week-ends, a seven day event
Your friends, a plethora of men
Sisters, they always know the truth
Blisters, the scars of the abuse, the abuse is you

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
You’re numb to the ages, you’re chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!

Weather, have to weather the storm
Never, have I seen as much abnorm
Features, the smiles are pretend
Creatures, they mob you ‘til the end, it’s the end my friend

Pins and needles, needles and pins
A lack of circulation, the pain begins
You’re numb to the ages, you’re chilled to the bone
Needles and pins, please leave me, leave me alone!!!
