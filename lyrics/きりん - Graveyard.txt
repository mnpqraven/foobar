When paradise is burning
Ten scriptural plagues of death
When water turns to blood
As shadows starts to breed again

When Eden turns to ash
As darkness devours the light
Black plague is creeping slowly
As shadows starts to breed again

The deathkult is rising
Rising from beneath the soil
The deathkult is rising
Rising from beyond the grave

In the name of the flesh
Ascension to the throne
In the name of flesh
We praise the lord of death
In the name of the flesh
Hear the gospel of the wretched
In the name of the flesh
We praise the lord of death

Chanting from the crypts
Where the horror never stops
Moan beneath the blackest sky
Raise your hands to die

In the name of the flesh
We return to kill the light
In the name of the flesh
In darkness and might

Black breath
Slow death
A necrotic revelation
World wide funeral
A black pile of rotten flesh
