Oh, I know that lady can look so fine
A blonde angel with such a sweet smile
You feel like you can ride the sky like a super-nova
But how can you and such a sweetheart walk the same road?

[BRIDGE]
A jewel set in sterling silver
An angel with eyes that shine like amber
She's a cherokee on the war path, and you're her pray

[CHORUS]
Dark shiny boots the hunter she wears
She's a saint but how she can make you scream
A gorgeous Valentine, so swift to wreak Mayhem
A viper in your bed, such a savage emotion

Your summers have never been so wild since you've met that missy
She can enter your skin like an ancient curse from Asia
It's a canyon of lust when that temptress takes your heart
But if you want to leave her, my friend, you can't just turn the page

There's a crystal in her eyes that mekes her shine like a star
A rider on a horse of sin, meet the lords she serves

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
