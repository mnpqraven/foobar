Immersed in an eternal torment of hate
The visceral desire to indulge the bestial mark
Lead step by step to an abominable universe
A world dominated by the only master of vengeance
Absent of the lower plot of humanity
Where strong and powerful spirits assuage their desire
Refuse the submission rejecting all forms of morality
With only the strong desire to impose their personality
To mark with red iron the imprint of supreme domination
The servants will have no other destiny than submission
Their blood spilled shall be the symbol of accomplishment
Of their sacrifice the apocalypse shall be realized
