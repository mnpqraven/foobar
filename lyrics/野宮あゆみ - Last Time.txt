Your mother always wanted you to live that truth
And now that you've turned away from honesty, you lose
How can you justify the reasons you missed out?
And you're just living in a place that's down and out Countless days in a world of make believe
You think you've got it made, but there's no harmony Asylum City
So many men torn apart
I choose to fight from the start
In Asylum City Hot winds, cold winds blow you back against the wall
You cry for help but in a deaf man's ear you call
I've seen 1,000 faces fade into the night
Their feelings can't conceal the ways of wrong and right Countless days in a world of make believe
You think you've got it made, but there's no harmony Asylum City
So many men torn apart
I choose to fight from the start
In Asylum City Countless days in a world of make believe
You think you've got it made but there's no harmony Asylum City
So many men torn apart
I choose to fight from the start
In Asylum City
