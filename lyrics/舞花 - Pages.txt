Don't, Don't tell
Don't tell me what to dream

Why can't you feel this? All the misery and the pain
the self-neglect, the values...have driven me insane
Its time to remember, the reason that you were named
The gallant acts from which, from which we all came

Don't tell me what to dream. Don't tell me
I'd rather go it alone than stand next to you
Don't tell me. Don't tell me what to dream

Don't. Don't tell
Don't tell me what to dream

For what I survived, no stomach
For the lies you say and do...you say and do
Make no mistake I see what is here
The emptiness of your words comes alive
The facts are evident, your actions are clear

Don't tell me what to dream. Don't tell me
I'd rather go it alone than stand next to you
Don't tell me. Don't tell me what to dream
