Where the rainbow meets the sky
In the mountains, so gleaming so high
There, the wizard spoke his rhymes
Calling back the ancient times
When magic has rules
Over earth, sea and air

Damned for years in his den
Chasing forces in this lonesome hidden glen
The black power he has never served before
Shadowed him forevermore

In the village near by
A lady spreads her beauty like a butterfly
Her golden hair is blowing in the wind
Dreaming of the wizard's fate

And the crystal ball shows salvation so soon
When wolves are howling at the moon
To break the spell and sing the tune

She's finding out the secrets full of taunting lies
Hidden in the night time skies
With white magic she allies

She came to touch the wizard's magic wand
To break the spell that frees him from his cell
The good power always will reveal

The stones they've been throwing
In that winter's snowing
The chants will be flowing
Again in fairyland
Then, magic has won
And you'll be the one
To spread the wizard's tale
The wizard
The wizard
The wizard
Just spread the wizard's tale
