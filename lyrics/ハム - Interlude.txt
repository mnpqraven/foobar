An ashen flat conceals me inside
From the stomach of the petrified prison
I peer the obscure world
Without locks it holds me

A manic world
Created by a thought

An insight of the mankind
An invention from misery
They turned a stone into gold
Mida's time comes

A flight of birds
In the grey bliss

Thy eternal abyss, a warm lap of the mother
Absorbs my body inside, but my soul's left

Darkness surrounds me (solitary)
From the clay, grey misery...
DARK PARADISE

I'm staring, lifelessness to nothing
I'm gazing at the point in my nerves

From the soil arises
Unholy kingdom for hypocrites
In the dark lowlands
There's my dark paradise

Incubus continues
My black blood is filled by air
