The spell was cast and sky drowns in dark
Everlasting grief will enslave land once so bright
And destroy the lives in roots of lights
All secrets gone for darkness to permeate

And when dawn falls dark will keep the night
Eclipse of feeble opens the ways of damnation
Night returns memories of fallen one
My horizons are endless towards the enchanting dark

The fate is lost in the veil of darkest bane
In the gloomy skies for the ages of no return
Those who bewail false sights of lights
Will gone with the prayers beyong fading tears

And when dawn falls dark will keep the night
Eclipse of feeble sun opens the ways of damnation
Night reveals memories of fallen one
My horizons are endless towards enchanting dark
