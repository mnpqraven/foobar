We are back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker
Put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck
We are the German nightmare

We are back in the bizz
The scene is under attack
Rims are spinning fast
Of the deep black cadillac

Kings of the underground
Back on the hunting ground
Stick your hands up
Pay the bill, hail the crown

When the score has to settle
Push the pedal to the metal
Backyard fights
In front of headlight dazzles

We sound like a gun
It goes boom boom pow
Let us share the black credit card
And pump up the sound

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever

We are back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker
Put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck
We are the German nightmare

The EC is back
We put some meth on the track
Spitting rhymes like a shotgun
Dead on target

Still the coolest motherfuckers
Of the hood
Blowing up your speakers
Everytime our bass drops

2010
Sippin bombay with a straw
Come into your club
Pay the bill with a chainsaw

We sound like a gun
It goes boom boom pow
Let us share the black credit card
And pump up the sound

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever

Yeah
I'll tell you
Once and forever

We are back in the bizz
And it goes like this
Come on motherfucker
Put your hands in the air
We don't give a fuck
We are the German nightmare

We're everything that you wanted
Pushed it back where it started
What we made will last forever, forever
We're back from the ashes
Turn hate into passion
What we made will last forever
