There I was I was hanging around 
Two Fingers down one to go 
Then suddenly from below she emerges 
Sultry swingin' from a rope 
"You've got something I need so just give me your hand" 
Trust is something that I just got to give into 
My Black widow or friend? 
Well? In the blink of an eye systems deploy 
And we are off baby off on the run 
Bullets raining on down 
Wind driven snow here we go 
Amidst the fury I was clinging onto her 
As our tether slid down the cliff 
She wouldn't answer pressed a 
Poison tip dagger to the base of my neck 
"how bout we strike a deal all your secrets for your life" 
She was good and she was getting better 
Might just hafta hang on for a while 
Fighter planes start to dive 
A barrage of gunfire 
Rips through the snow 
Snipers bearing on down 
She turns to me 
But we're not lost 
We're just going with the of another busy day 
Hey baby welcome to my crystal palace 
Just what did you expect 
I turned in time to see the avalanche start 
A freight train right at my head
