I'm feeling like I'm still in the same old situation
I'm speaking but no one's listening, it's the same old conversation
But I know there's no hope

I'm waiting for something, something to happen
I'm hating procrastinating but I can't find the motivation
But I know there's no hope

And you can't believe you're walking through this hell
Cause all you wish to be - wish you were someone else
And all hope's lost again

I'm seeing but not believing, is it just my imagination?
I'm dreaming of devastationof this whole entire generation
But we know there's no hope
