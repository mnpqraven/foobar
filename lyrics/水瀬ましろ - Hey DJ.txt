Where's my limit?
Where is my drive?
Where's all the energy I once had inside?
Where's my spirit?
Where is my pride?
Where are my two egos?
Where do they collide?

Sometimes I'm breaking down
Don't know where to start
Sometimes I feel I cannot breath
I cannot eat anymore

Who says?
Who says?

Sometimes when I get up
Don't know how to stand
Sometimes I feel I live two lives
But I am walking behind

You say
Who says?
There is no
There is no chance to split?
You say
Who says?
There's no way that I could fit?

You are, you are
A confused dancing star,
Moving fast through the night
So far, so far,
The night's getting bizarre,
Turn around to the light

So tell me why
Tell me why
Why I am feeling pretty fine here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

So tell me why
Tell me why
It feels so good
It feels so right here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

My feelings drive me into two different directions
Sometimes I crash, I crash
Sometimes I'm crashing into myself

You say
Who says?
There is no
There is no chance to split?
You say
Who says?
There's no way that I could fit?

Where's my limit?
Where is my drive?
Where's all the energy I once had inside?
Where's my spirit?
Where is my pride?
Where are my two egos?
Where do they collide?

You are, you are
A confused dancing star,
Moving fast through the night
So far, so far,
The night's getting bizarre,
Turn around to the light

So tell
So tell me why 
Tell me why
Why I am feeling pretty fine here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

So tell me why
Tell me why
It feels so good
It feels so right here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

So tell me why 
Tell me why
Why I am feeling pretty fine here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

So tell me why
Tell me why
It feels so good
It feels so right here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
For da lifetime
For da lifetime
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
Catching me, catching me out on the ridge
For da lifetime
For da lifetime

You come back down
You come back down to earth with a bang
Your time's running out
But don't lose heart!
Don't lose yourself and stand up!
Stand up!
Come on and get up!

So tell me why 
Tell me why
Why I am feeling pretty fine here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

So tell me why
Tell me why
It feels so good
It feels so right here
On the dance floor
On the dance floor

Is there no other place where I can settle down, down?
I need more space, more space where I can jump around, round
So tell me how
Tell me how
I can make myself a brand-new
Polished dance floor
Polished dance floor
